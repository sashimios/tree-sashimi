This patch is introduced to resolve an autogen failure. 

In AOSC, when generating autotool's configutration files, autogen will try to
search libtool's executable in the PATH, which returns `/bin/libtool` instead
of `/usr/bin/libtool`, leading to a failure when trying to access a file via 
relate path. This is caused by our configutration of bash-startup. Since 
modifying it may cause other problems, this patch is introduced as
a workaround.
